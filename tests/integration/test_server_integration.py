Server Integration Verification Tests

Tests the server functionality end-to-end, particularly:
- AsyncIO event loop handling (the fix we just made)
- Server startup without crashes
- Basic WebSocket connectivity
- Graceful shutdown handling

These tests verify that the server actually works, complementing the CLI smoke tests.

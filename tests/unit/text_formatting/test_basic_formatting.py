Comprehensive tests for basic text formatting: capitalization and punctuation.

This module tests the core formatting behaviors:
- Sentence capitalization
- Punctuation addition/restoration
- Entity protection during formatting
- Special punctuation rules (e.g., abbreviations)
- Idiomatic expression preservation
